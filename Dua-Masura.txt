Allahumma Inni Zalamtu Nafsi Zulman Qaseeraun Wala Yaghfiruz Zunooba Illa Anta 
Faghfirlee Maghfiram Min Indika Warhamnee Innaka Antal Gafoorur Raheem


O Allah (ï·»), Verily! I have wronged myself much and there is no one who forgives
sins without you. Grant me forgiveness from You and have mercy on me. Indeed you
are the most forgiving, the most merciful.
