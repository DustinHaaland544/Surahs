Near-death experiences (NDEs) are subjective experiences reported by individuals who have come close to death or have been in life-threatening situations. They often
include a range of phenomena such as feelings of peace, a sense of leaving the body, moving through a tunnel, encountering deceased loved ones, and having a life
review. However, it's important to note that the interpretation and understanding of NDEs are still subjects of scientific investigation and debate.

From a scientific perspective, NDEs are considered to be experiences that occur within the brain during a period of altered brain function. Several scientific
theories attempt to explain the phenomenon based on neurological and psychological factors. Here are a few prominent scientific perspectives:

Psychological and Neurological Explanations: These theories suggest that NDEs are the result of physiological and psychological processes occurring in the brain
during extreme circumstances. Some propose that NDEs are a product of reduced oxygen supply to the brain, leading to altered states of consciousness and vivid
hallucinations. Others suggest that they may be caused by the release of endorphins, changes in brain chemistry, or abnormal activity in specific brain regions.

Cognitive and Memory Processes: Some scientists propose that NDEs are the result of cognitive and memory processes. For example, the "dying brain hypothesis"
suggests that NDEs are a manifestation of the brain's attempt to make sense of the dying process, combining fragments of memories, cultural beliefs, and expectations
into a coherent experience.

Psychological Coping Mechanisms: Another perspective suggests that NDEs serve as psychological coping mechanisms during life-threatening situations. They may provide
a sense of comfort, reassurance, or emotional healing for individuals facing distressing circumstances.

It's worth noting that while scientific research has made progress in understanding certain aspects of NDEs, the subjective and deeply personal nature of these
experiences makes them challenging to study rigorously. Additionally, alternative explanations, including spiritual and metaphysical interpretations, coexist
alongside scientific theories, emphasizing the complex and multifaceted nature of NDEs.
