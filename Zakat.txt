Zakat should be paid to eligible recipients who are in need and meet certain criteria as outlined in Islamic jurisprudence. In general, there are eight categories of recipients of zakat as defined in the Quran, which are:
The poor (al-fuqarāʾ)
The needy (al-masākīn)
The collectors of zakat (al-ʿāmilīn)
Those whose hearts are to be reconciled (al-muʾallafatu qulūbihim)
The slaves and captives (fir-rīqāb)
Those in debt (al-gharimīn)
In the cause of Allah (fī sabīlillāh)
The wayfarer (ibnus-sabīl)
It is recommended to give Zakat to a local Islamic organization that is authorized to collect Zakat and distribute it to eligible recipients. It is important to
ensure that the organization you choose is reputable and trustworthy, and that it distributes the Zakat in accordance with Islamic teachings. Some Islamic
organizations have established Zakat committees to oversee the collection and distribution of Zakat, while others may work with local mosques or other community
organizations to distribute Zakat to eligible recipients.

It is generally permissible to donate to a mosque as a form of Zakat payment, but there are certain conditions that must be met to ensure that the donation is 
considered Zakat and fulfills the obligation.
Firstly, the mosque must be authorized to collect and distribute Zakat, and it should have a designated Zakat committee or similar authority responsible for
overseeing the collection and distribution of Zakat.
Secondly, the donation should be clearly designated as Zakat and not as a general donation or contribution. This means that you should inform the mosque that you 
are paying your Zakat, and they should keep a record of the payment as such.
Thirdly, the donation should be distributed to eligible Zakat recipients as defined in Islamic jurisprudence, such as the poor, needy, and other eligible 
categories. The mosque should have a system in place to ensure that the Zakat funds are distributed appropriately.
In summary, while it is permissible to pay Zakat as a donation to a mosque, it is important to ensure that the mosque is authorized to collect and distribute Zakat,
that the donation is clearly designated as Zakat, and that the funds are distributed to eligible Zakat recipients.
