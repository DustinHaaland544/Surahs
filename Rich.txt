Ask Allah to give you more, as long as it is good for you,
and to bless you with what he has already given you.

Oh Allah! Make me content with what you have given to me,
and put blessing in which you have given to me, and let 
everything that I have missed out to be replaced with 
something that is better

Allah is putting something ahead of us that is better for
us, so as long as we respond with that which is good.
