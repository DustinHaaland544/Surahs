"HASBUNALLAHU WA NI'MAL WAKEEL; NI'MAL MAULA WANI'MAN WAKEEL" is an Arabic phrase that can be translated as:

"Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs. What an excellent protector and what an excellent helper."

This phrase is derived from a verse in the Qur'an (Surah Al 'Imran, verse 173) and is often recited by Muslims in times of difficulty or distress as a means of
seeking solace and putting their trust in Allah. It expresses the belief that Allah alone is sufficient to handle and take care of all matters, and that He is the
ultimate source of protection and assistance. By reciting this phrase, Muslims acknowledge their reliance on Allah's guidance and support in every aspect of their
lives.
