The night before Eid al-Fitr, known as Laylat al-Ja'izah (the Night of Reward), is a blessed time in Islam. An ideal Muslim should spend it in worship, gratitude, 
and preparation for Eid. Here’s how one can maximize its blessings:

1. Engaging in Worship & Remembrance of Allah

- Takbeer (Glorifying Allah)
  -> Recite the Takbeer loudly (if possible) from sunset on the last day of Ramadan until the Eid prayer:
    "Allāhu Akbar, Allāhu Akbar, Lā ilāha illallāh, Allāhu Akbar, Allāhu Akbar, wa lillāhil-ḥamd."
    ("Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, there is no god but Allah; Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, and to Allah belongs all praise.")

- Night Prayer (Qiyam al-Layl / Tahajjud)
  -> Spend part of the night in voluntary prayers, seeking forgiveness and closeness to Allah.

- Recitation of the Qur’an
  -> Reflect on the Qur’an, especially verses about gratitude and mercy.

- Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah)
  -> Engage in SubhanAllah, Alhamdulillah, La ilaha illallah, and Allahu Akbar.
  -> Seek forgiveness through Astaghfirullah and Salawat (sending blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ).

2. Giving Charity (Sadaqah)

- The night before Eid is a great time to give extra charity, ensuring the needy can also enjoy Eid.

3. Preparing for Eid

- Physical Preparation
  -> Take a bath (Ghusl) in the morning for Eid.
  -> Wear clean, modest, and preferably new clothes.
  -> Apply perfume (non-alcoholic for men, and only at home for women).

- Spiritual Preparation
  -> Renew intentions to please Allah and celebrate Eid in a halal manner.
  -> Avoid extravagance, arrogance, or sinful behavior.

4. Avoiding Sinful Acts

- Stay away from:
  -> Music, gossip, backbiting, and wasting time.
  -> Free mixing (for non-mahrams) and inappropriate behavior.

5. Making Dua (Supplication)

- This night is a time when duas are accepted. Ask Allah for:
  -> Forgiveness, guidance, and blessings in this life and the hereafter.
  -> Acceptance of Ramadan’s fasting, prayers, and good deeds.
  -> Relief for the Ummah and oppressed Muslims worldwide.

6. Sleeping Early to Wake Up for Eid Prayer

- Ensure you rest early to wake up fresh for Fajr prayer and the Eid congregation.

Hadith on the Virtue of Eid Night

The Prophet ﷺ said:
"Whoever stays up (in worship) on the nights of the two Eids expecting reward from Allah, his heart will not die on the day when hearts die (Day of Judgment)." 
(Ibn Majah, authenticated by Al-Albani)

Conclusion
An ideal Muslim should spend Eid night in worship, gratitude, and preparation—balancing between spiritual devotion and joyful yet halal celebration. May Allah 
accept our Ramadan and grant us a blessed Eid! Eid Mubarak! 🌙✨
