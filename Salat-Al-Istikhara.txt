Dua for Istikhara:

Allahumma inni istakhira ka b'ilmika,
wa istaqdiru ka b'qudratika,
wa as'aluka min fadlikal-aẓīmi.
Fa innaka taqdiru walā aqdir,
wata'lamu walā a'lam,
wa anta 'allāmul-ghuyūbiyyi wal-mukhfiyāti,
wa in kunta ta'lamu anna hādhal-amra khayrun lī fī dīnī wa-ma'āshī wa-'āqibati amrī
aw ājili amrī wa-ājilihi,
faqdirhu lī wa-yassirhu lī thumma barik lī fīhi.
Wa in kunta ta'lamu anna hādhal-amra sharrun lī fī dīnī wa-ma'āshī wa-'āqibati amrī
aw ājili amrī wa-ājilihi,
fasrifhu 'annī wasrifnī 'anhu.
Wa āqdir liy-s-s-skhayra ḥaythu kāna thumma arḍi-nī.

O Allah, I seek Your guidance [in making a choice] by virtue of Your knowledge,
and I seek ability by virtue of Your power,
and I ask You of Your great bounty.
You have power; I have none.
And You know; I know not.
You are the Knower of the unseen.
O Allah, if You know that this matter [mention your need] is good for me in my religion and my subsistence
and in the end of my affair, then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me.
And if You know that this matter is bad for me in my religion and my subsistence
and in the end of my affair, then turn it away from me and turn me away from it.
And ordain for me the good wherever it may be, and make me pleased with it.
