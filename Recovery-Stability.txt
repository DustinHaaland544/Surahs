ALLAHUMMA INNI AS'ALUKA AL-MU'AFATAH
FID-DUNYA WAL-AKHIRAH

O' ALLAH INDEED I ASK YOU FOR AL-MU'AFATAH
IN THIS WORLD AND IN THE AKHIRAH

AL-MU'AFATAH literally means RECOVERY
or somebody who is on the path of getting 
good health and strength and starting 
to recover from whatever pain or struggle 
they are going through.

YOU'RE ASKING ALLAH FOR STABILITY IN LIFE.

SO, AL-MU'AFATAH IS YOU'RE ASKING ALLAH ANYTHING 
THAT YOU NEED TO CONFRONT THAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE
TO DO THAT WITH THE BEST OF HEALTH AND STRENGTH

DUA-2: The Prophet (PBUH) used to say,
"ALLAHUMMA ASLIH LI DEENI ALLADHI
HUWA ISMATU AMRI".

"OH ALLAH, MAKE THE SOURCE THAT KEEPS ME 
STABLE AND CORRECTS MY LIFE AND KEEPS ME 
PROTECTED IN THIS WORLD, MAKE IT MY RELIGION"

So, the first thing that you're asking 
Allah in this dua is 

"OH ALLAH ALLOW MY RELIGION
TO BE THE SOURCE THAT RESOLVES ALL OF MY PROBLEMS,
THAT GIVES ME ALL OF THE PROTECTION, THAT PROVIDES ME 
ALL DIRECTIONS AND GUIDANCE AND SOLUTIONS IN MY LIFE".
