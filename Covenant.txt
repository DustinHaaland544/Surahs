The fate of the Ark of the Covenant, one of the most famous religious artifacts in Judeo-Christian tradition, remains a mystery. Its final location has been the 
subject of much debate, with interpretations drawn from both ancient scriptures and modern archaeology. Here's a summary of the most prominent theories:

Ancient Scriptures and Textual Evidence:
Biblical Accounts: The Ark was originally housed in the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. According to the Bible, the Ark disappeared after the Babylonian conquest 
of Jerusalem in 587 BCE, when the temple was destroyed. The Bible is ambiguous about what happened to the Ark afterward, leaving its fate a mystery.

2 Maccabees (Apocrypha): According to this account (2 Maccabees 2:4-8), the prophet Jeremiah took the Ark and hid it in a cave on Mount Nebo (modern-day Jordan) 
before the Babylonian siege, where it would remain hidden until God regathers His people.

Ethiopian Claim: One of the most persistent legends, recounted in the Kebra Nagast (a 14th-century Ethiopian manuscript), holds that the Ark was taken to Ethiopia. 
The Ethiopian Orthodox Church claims that the Ark has been kept in the Church of St. Mary of Zion in Axum, where only the "Guardian of the Ark" is allowed to see 
it.

Modern Archaeological Theories:
Temple Mount Excavations: Some archaeologists believe the Ark could still be hidden beneath the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. However, political and religious 
tensions have prevented extensive excavations in this area. Some scholars theorize that it might have been hidden in a secret chamber under the Temple before the 
Babylonians arrived.

Tanis, Egypt: In the 1930s, archaeologist Pierre Montet discovered a treasure trove in the city of Tanis, Egypt. While the Ark was not found, some theories suggest 
that the Ark might have been taken to Egypt for safekeeping during the reign of Pharaoh Shoshenq I, who is sometimes linked with the biblical Shishak, who invaded 
Jerusalem after Solomon's reign.

Southern Africa: British author Graham Hancock popularized the idea in his book The Sign and the Seal that the Ark was taken to Elephantine Island in Egypt and 
later moved to Ethiopia. This theory aligns with the Ethiopian claim but suggests a more complex route for the Ark's travels.

Lemba People of Zimbabwe: The Lemba, a tribe in Southern Africa, claim that their ancestors carried the Ark south from Jerusalem and built a replica known as the 
ngoma lungundu, a drum-like object they revere. Archaeological evidence suggests that they might indeed have possessed a sacred object with biblical associations, 
though it is not conclusively the Ark.

Where is the Ark Now?
Ethiopian Church of St. Mary of Zion: The strongest living claim today comes from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which insists the Ark is in their custody in Axum. 
However, no one outside the clergy is permitted to view it, and no archaeological evidence has been provided to verify its existence.

Hidden in Jerusalem: Some archaeologists believe the Ark could still be hidden somewhere beneath the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, possibly in a concealed chamber. 
However, no conclusive evidence has been found to support this theory due to restricted excavation rights.

Lost or Destroyed: Many historians believe the Ark could have been destroyed during the Babylonian invasion or lost to history. There's also the possibility that 
it was hidden and remains undiscovered.

Conclusion:
There is no universally accepted, conclusive archaeological evidence regarding the current location of the Ark of the Covenant. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church's 
claim remains one of the most persistent and intriguing, but it is unverified by modern scientific methods. Mount Nebo in Jordan and Jerusalem's Temple Mount are 
also considered potential resting places, though none of these theories have been definitively proven.
