The title of the "oldest running church in the world" is a matter of debate and can be somewhat subjective depending on how one defines a church and what criteria 
are used to determine its age. Several churches claim to be among the oldest in the world, and it's often challenging to definitively establish their ages due to 
the lack of historical records.

However, one of the contenders for the title of the oldest running church is the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, Palestine. This church is traditionally 
believed to have been built on the site where Jesus Christ was born. The original church was constructed in the 4th century, making it one of the oldest 
Christian churches in continuous use.

Another contender is the Church of St. Mary in Trier, Germany. This church, also known as the Cathedral of Trier or Trier Dom, was built in the 4th century
and has been in continuous use since that time. It is the oldest cathedral in Germany.

These claims are based on historical and archaeological evidence, but there are other ancient churches around the world that make similar assertions. It's 
important to note that the concept of a "church" has evolved over time, and many early Christian meeting places were not as elaborate as modern churches. As 
a result, determining the "oldest" church can be a matter of interpretation and historical documentation.


The title of the oldest running mosque in the world is a matter of historical debate and can be challenging to definitively establish due to the evolving nature 
of Islamic architecture and worship spaces. Several mosques claim to be among the oldest, and the determination of their ages can be complicated by factors like 
restorations and reconstructions over the centuries.

One of the contenders for the title of the oldest running mosque is the Quba Mosque (Masjid Quba) in Medina, Saudi Arabia. This mosque is traditionally believed 
to be the first mosque built by the Prophet Muhammad and his companions upon their arrival in Medina in the year 622 CE (1 AH in the Islamic calendar). It has 
undergone numerous renovations and reconstructions, but the original foundation is attributed to the time of the Prophet Muhammad, making it one of the oldest 
known mosques in the world.

The Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, is also considered one of the earliest places of Islamic worship, and while it's not a traditional mosque, it holds immense 
religious significance in Islam. The Kaaba is believed to have been constructed by the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Isma'il (Ishmael) and later became 
the focal point of Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj).

It's important to note that many early Islamic prayer spaces and mosques were simple structures made of mud bricks or palm fronds and were often rebuilt and 
expanded over time. As a result, determining the "oldest" mosque can be a matter of interpretation and historical documentation.


The title of the oldest running synagogue in the world is a matter of historical debate and can be challenging to definitively establish due to the complex 
history of Jewish communities and the changing nature of synagogue buildings. Several synagogues claim to be among the oldest, and determining their ages can 
be complicated by factors like restorations and reconstructions over the centuries.

One of the contenders for the title of the oldest running synagogue is the Erdőbénye Synagogue in Hungary. It is believed to date back to the late 12th century, 
making it one of the oldest synagogue buildings still in use. The synagogue has undergone renovations and changes over the centuries but maintains its historical 
significance.

Another contender is the Old New Synagogue in Prague, Czech Republic. This synagogue is one of the oldest in Europe and is traditionally believed to have been 
built in the late 13th century. It is still used for religious services today.

Additionally, the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Cairo, Egypt, is considered one of the oldest synagogues in the world. It is believed to have been constructed in the 9th 
century. Although it is no longer an active place of worship, it is an important historical and cultural site.

As with other ancient religious buildings, determining the "oldest" synagogue can be a matter of interpretation, and it's important to consider factors like 
renovations and historical documentation. The specific title of the "oldest" synagogue can vary depending on the criteria used.
