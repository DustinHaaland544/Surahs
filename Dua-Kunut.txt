Allah humma inna nasta-eenoka wa nastaghfiruka wa nu'minu bika wa natawakkalu alaika wa nusni alaikal khair, 
wa nashkuruka wala nakfuruka wa nakhla-oo wa natruku mai yafjuruka, Allah humma iyyaka na'budu wa laka nusalli
wa nasjud wa ilaika nas aaa wa nahfizu wa narju rahma taka wa nakhshaa azaabaka inna azaabaka bil kuffari mulhik

O Allah! We implore You for help and beg forgiveness of You and believe in You and rely on You and extol You and
we are thankful to You and are not ungrateful to You and we alienate and forsake those who disobey You. O Allah!
You alone do we worship and for You do we pray and prostrate and we betake to please You and present ourselves 
for the service in Your cause and we hope for Your mercy and fear Your chastisement. Undoubtedly, Your torment
is going to overtake infidels O Allah!

At-Tirmidhi: 464, Abu Dawud: 1425
