Bismillahil-lazee la ya-dur-ru ma’as-mihi shai’un fil-ardi wa la fis-sama’i, wa Hu-was-Sami’ul-‘Alim

In the Name of Allah, Who with His Name
nothing can cause harm in the earth nor in
the heavens, and He is the All-Hearing, the
All-Knowing.

& 3x After Asr onwards.

Please keep me in your duas 
Wa alaikumsalam.
