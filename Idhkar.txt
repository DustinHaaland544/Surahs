Say, morning and evening, ‘“Allahumma inni a’oodhu bika min al-hammi wa’l-hazani, wa a’oodhi bika min al-‘ajzi wa’l-kasali, wa a’oodhu bika min al-jubni wa’l-bukhli, 
wa a’oodhi bika min ghalabat il-dayn wa qahri al-rijaal"

O Allah, I seek refuge with You from worry and grief, and I seek refuge with You from incapacity and laziness,
and I seek refuge with You from cowardice and miserliness, and I seek refuge with You from being heavily indebt and from being overcome by men

He said, I did that, and Allah took away my worry and paid off my debt.
